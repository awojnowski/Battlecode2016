Battlecode TODO:

- Archons should only spawn units if they’re near other units (when they get parts they should grab them then run back)

Post-Sprint Thoughts:

- Read the zombie schedule to figure out best plan of action
- Possibly use guards as a front line against zombies to do damage and take damage
- Mark neutrals and part clumps on the broadcasting system
- Some kind of anti-funnel strategy (would be really tricky)
- Don’t make our archons try to get unsafe ore!

Post-Seeding:

- Try to move soldiers in clumps?
- Prioritize dens based on which ones are closer to us than the enemy
- Have injured units go back to archons to get healed (would need to have friendly archon locations in communication as well)
- Have turrets follow around soldiers then have the soldiers kite back into the turrets
- Have better awareness of where the enemy is (don’t just run to enemy spawn)
- Kite guards with soldiers
- Try to kite other soldiers (wait for them to come to us)
- Spawn vipers if we’re outnumbered late game
- Possibly activate neutrals before building robots? (and count them as built units)
- Have archons and soldiers play safer if we’re outnumbered (game against hungry games where we got ridiculously lucky lol)
- Make archons flee towards our soldiers for safety (would need to have our soldier clumps in communication as well)
- Note what direction zombies come from to find their dens
